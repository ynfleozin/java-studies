# Java Backend Learning Journey ☕

This repository documents my structured learning path to become a backend developer using Java and Spring Boot.

Instead of isolated tutorials, this is a hands-on progression focused on building solid foundations in object-oriented programming, data handling, persistence, and modern backend development practices.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Develop strong backend engineering skills by applying concepts through incremental implementations, refactoring exercises, and small systems built during each stage.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap

### Weeks 1–8 — Core Java Foundations

Focus on language fundamentals and clean coding practices.

- Variables, conditionals, loops, and methods
- Object-Oriented Programming (composition, inheritance, polymorphism)
- SOLID principles applied in small systems
- Collections, Generics, and data structures
- Exception handling and debugging
- File I/O (JSON / CSV)
- JDBC and SQL persistence
- Streams, Optional, and date/time API
- Multithreading fundamentals
- Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito

📌 Deliverables:
- Logic katas
- Console-based mini systems
- CRUD using JDBC
- Data import/export features
- Refactoring exercises applying best practices

---

### Weeks 9–16 — Spring Boot & Modern Backend Development

Transition to building production-style APIs.

- Spring Core (IoC, DI, Controllers)
- REST API design with ResponseEntity
- JPA / Hibernate persistence
- DTO pattern and validation
- Global error handling and logging
- Spring Security fundamentals
- JWT authentication and authorization
- Integration and unit testing
- API documentation with Swagger

📌 Deliverables:
- Complete REST API
- Authentication system with JWT
- Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Tested endpoints and documented API

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC
- JUnit / Mockito
- Git

---

## 📈 What This Repository Represents

This is not a course repository.

It is a deliberate practice environment where I:
- Reinforce backend fundamentals
- Apply architecture patterns
- Write maintainable and testable code
- Simulate real-world backend scenarios

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

The final goal is to evolve this foundation into production-ready backend services and full-stack integrations with Angular applications.
